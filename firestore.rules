/**
 * @fileOverview Security rules for the JasTip Express application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles,
 * orders, and notas. Jastip events are publicly readable.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information.
 * - /users/{userId}/orders/{orderId}: Stores orders associated with a specific user.
 * - /users/{userId}/orders/{orderId}/notas/{notaId}: Stores notas/receipts for orders.
 * - /events/{eventId}: Stores information about Jastip events.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User data is private and only accessible to the user themselves.
 * - Users can only manage their own orders and notas.
 * - Events are publicly readable but not writable through the client.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - The path `/users/{userId}/orders/{orderId}` inherently denormalizes the `userId` onto the order document.
 *  - The path `/users/{userId}/orders/{orderId}/notas/{notaId}` inherently denormalizes both the `userId` and `orderId` onto the nota document.
