/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for JasTip Express.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles,
 * orders, and notas. Each user has full control over their own data.
 * Top-level Jastip events are publicly readable, with owner-only writes (currently not enforced due to a missing owner field).
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information.
 * - /users/{userId}/orders/{orderId}: Stores orders associated with a specific user.
 * - /users/{userId}/orders/{orderId}/notas/{notaId}: Stores notas associated with a specific order.
 * - /events/{eventId}: Stores information about Jastip events (public read, owner write).
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - Owner-only access is enforced for all user-related data (users, orders, notas).
 * - Jastip events are publicly readable.
 * - Data validation is limited to authorization-critical fields during create operations.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - The userId is embedded in the path for orders and notas, enabling path-based authorization.
