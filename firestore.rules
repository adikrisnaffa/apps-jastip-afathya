/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for JasTip Express.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles, orders, and notas.
 * Jastip events are publicly readable but require authentication for creation, updates, and deletion.
 * Shipping details can be written by anonymous or authenticated users to a specific subcollection.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information.
 * - /users/{userId}/shipping_details/{shippingId}: Stores shipping addresses linked to a user, potentially from anonymous sessions.
 * - /orders/{orderId}: Stores all orders for all events.
 * - /events/{eventId}: Stores information about Jastip events. These are intended to be publicly readable.
 * - /activity_logs/{logId}: Stores audit logs.
 *
