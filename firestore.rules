/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for JasTip Express application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all data. Each user has full control over their own profile and associated orders and notas.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The database is structured with user profiles at the root level (`/users/{userId}`), and user-specific data (orders, notas) nested under each user. This structure enables path-based authorization.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed to protect privacy.
 * - All write operations are strictly controlled to ensure that only the owner can modify their data.
 * - The rules are designed for Authorization Independence, avoiding the need for costly `get()` calls.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The Firestore structure denormalizes user ownership by nesting all user-related data under the `/users/{userId}` path. This enables fast, path-based authorization checks without needing to read other documents. For example, order documents are located at `/users/{userId}/orders/{orderId}` enabling order access control based solely on the path.
